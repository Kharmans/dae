## v0.2.0
Quite a lot of changes under the hood in this one.
DAE is compatible with and requires 0.7.4 and in anticipation of changes in 0.75 there are lots UI changes.
1. **The effects tab has been removed** (0.7.5 will add one back) Actors and Items now have a title bar option "Active Effects" that brings up a list of effects which you can edit to your hearts content and it uses the new 0.7.4 edit screen with some extra wrinkles to list availabe fields, restrict the available modes and provides a dropdown for fields that have defined values.
2. **Editing Owned Item effects has been disabled** (pending resolution in the 0.7.5 release. So if you want to change the Active Effects definition of an owned item you must drag it to the sidebar, edit it and drag it back.

* All armor effects are active only if calculate armor is true.
* Added base AC = 10 + dex mod for characters only (so generic npcs won't have a base armor class). If you have actor enemies configured as characters you will need to set their armor or disable armor effects. The base AC is priority 1 so anything else will override it.
* Corrected armor effects, 
  * heavy armor ALWAYS just uses the armor value and the dex mod field is ignored.
  * medium armor defaults to a max dex mod of 2, but will use whatever is entered.
  * light armor defaults to a max dex mode of 99, but will use whatever is entered.
* Chnages to armor items automatically update the actor effects.

* First pass support for conditions, considered experimental. Toggle active conditions to none/CUB/default. You can specify an effect (flags.condition) which adds the condition to flags.dnd5e.conditions (a DAE only field).
  * If CUB is active and active conditions = "Combat utility belt" DAE will apply the CUB condition to the target.  
**Be aware that having the CUB module active disables the default behaviour of adding the active effect icon to the character and the default**
    * **Cub also disables the default creation of active effects when setting a condition from the HUD**  
  * If active conditions is set to default DAE will toggle the condition on the target token and apply cany conditions specified in CONFIG.statusEffects. (Over time I will implement a few/some/many of the actual condition effects in DAE/midi-qol).

* Support for quick entry items. There is a problem with quick entry adding the item, rather than the item data.

* Initial support for SW5E, there will be bugs - I promise. If there are other systems out there that are dnd5e with wrinkles they are pretty easy to support in DAE - just ping me.

* Corrected some migration issues not properly bringing acroos always active/active when equipped.

* Note for macro/module users. You can add your own custom effects without needing any DAE module changes. Say you want to add the average of str.mod and dex.mod to AC (and DAE does not support it) and the expressions don't work...
Core active effects have the idea of CUSTOM effects. If one is encountered when processing the active effects on an actor the system calls Hooks.call("appyActiveEffect")
  * Write a function that does
```
  Hooks.on("applyActiveEffect", myCustomEffect)
  
  function myCustomeEffect(actor, change) {
    // actor is the actor being processed and change is the target field
    // If your active effect spec was 
    // data.actor.attributes.ac.value (change.key) CUSTOM value (the value is not relevant here, but it gets passed as change.value)
    actor.data.data.attributes.ac.value += Math.ceil((actor.data.data.abilities.str.mod + actor.data.data.abilities.dex.mod) / 2);
  }
```
Your custom effects can create new fields on the actor as well (DAE does this for flags.dnd5e.conditions for example). Just reference the field in the active effect spec and it will be created on the actor when the custom effect updates the value.

## v0.1.8
Support add/remove macro/token magic effects for non-linked tokens.
Added compendium/actor fixup for data.bonuses.mwak/rwak/msak/rsak. See Readme.md
Fix data.spells.spelln.override active effects.
Fix for item migration not bringing across activeEquipped/AlwaysActive flags from dynamiceffects.
Fix for dice-so-nice integration not working properly with combo-cards.
Added a few other damage/attack bonus combinations custom fields.
Interim timeout was broken. Fixed version does the following:
* If about-time is installed, non-transfer effects are auto removed after game time duration as specified in the spell details. If no spell details exist they are removed after 6 real time seconds.
* If about-time is not installed effects are removed after spell details duration real time elapses or 6 real time seconds if no duration is specified.
* If about-time is not installed timeouts are not persistent across reloads.
