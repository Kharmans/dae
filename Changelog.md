## v0.1.8
Support add/remove macro/token magic effects for non-linked tokens.
Added compendium/actor fixup for data.bonuses.mwak/rwak/msak/rsak. See Readme.md
Fix data.spells.spelln.override active effects.
Fix for item migration not bringing across activeEquipped/AlwaysActive flags from dynamiceffects.
Fix for dice-so-nice integration not working properly with combo-cards.
Added a few other damage/attack bonus combinations custom fields.
Interim timeout was broken. Fixed version does the following:
* If about-time is installed, non-transfer effects are auto removed after game time duration as specified in the spell details. If no spell details exist they are removed after 6 real time seconds.
* If about-time is not installed effects are removed after spell details duration real time elapses or 6 real time seconds if no duration is specified.
* If about-time is not installed timeouts are not persistent across reloads.
